1
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,560
A major earthquake shook
the Caribbean nation of Haiti late today.

2
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,360
It hit just 14 miles
from the capital city Port-au-Prince.

3
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:31,400
The U.S. Geological Survey
reported a magnitude of 7.0,

4
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,000
the largest ever
recorded in that region.

5
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,640
Reports said the presidential
palace and a hospital collapsed

6
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,640
along with other buildings.

7
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,200
The president
and his wife escaped injury,

8
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,920
but thousands of other people
were killed or buried under rubble.

9
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,240
Magnitude 7.0 is the very
major quake and this one was shallow

10
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,760
and of course, you've noted
near a very large population center.

11
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,960
So we have,
unfortunately, the feeling

12
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,782
that this is going to be
a very devastating event.

13
00:01:03,032 --> 00:01:05,323
It’s half day
right now, it's a dark mo...

14
00:01:05,571 --> 00:01:08,072
I think it's one of
the darkest moments we've ever faced.

15
00:01:38,262 --> 00:01:39,762
I was at home.

16
00:01:39,762 --> 00:01:43,262
My house is built of wood.

17
00:01:43,262 --> 00:01:52,012
and suddenly
is started shaking, very strongly.

18
00:01:54,262 --> 00:01:58,012
I lay down and my children did too.

19
00:01:58,762 --> 00:02:00,762
We all lay down on the floor.

20
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,680
It was only after the earthquake
that we got up.

21
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,040
I went outside and I saw

22
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,120
houses broken down to pieces,

23
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,360
many people had died

24
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,440
and I started to scream, very loudly

25
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,640
"Oh my God

26
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,920
what is happening?

27
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,640
What is this?"

28
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,560
I have never seen anything like it
before in my life.

29
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:40,040
Then I went to my neighbours'

30
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,240
to help them free people

31
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,280
who got stuck under debris

32
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,840
We were celebrating Eucharist

33
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,240
that's when I felt earth movements.

34
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,240
Earth started to move and I have said
to the priest "Shall we go back home?

35
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,960
I have a feeling something bad
is going to happen."

36
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,800
So we went back to this place

37
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:15,360
and we just watched
the house, the school, without moving.

38
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,520
Luckily, we didn't stay inside,

39
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,320
we had time to get out and escape death.

40
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,760
There were people saying
"The end of the world is coming"

41
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,480
It was the first time

42
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,200
we have found ourselves
in a situation like this.

43
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,200
We didn't know this.

44
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:46,120
We have never seen an earthquake on Haiti,
this was the first.

45
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:52,560
People said: "The God has returned,
it is the day of reckoning."

46
00:04:53,491 --> 00:04:57,427
Sometimes the nets are empty, and
the next day we catch four hundred fish.

47
00:04:57,427 --> 00:05:02,070
I get 800-100 Haiti Dollars
for that.

48
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:06,035
We keep some
and sell the rest.

49
00:05:06,035 --> 00:05:13,049
Sometimes it takes just an hour
to pull up the fishing net,

50
00:05:13,049 --> 00:05:19,060
but often you will need four hours.

51
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,527
It is a hard work,
and it takes time.

52
00:05:28,973 --> 00:05:30,850
It is unpredictable too.

53
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,406
Sometimes you catch a lot fish,
that's great.

54
00:05:34,406 --> 00:05:38,138
But you can also spend days,

55
00:05:39,414 --> 00:05:42,737
with net set deep and still get nothing.

56
00:05:43,305 --> 00:05:48,952
But when you catch something you can sell,

57
00:05:48,952 --> 00:05:52,111
it provides some means of livelihood.

58
00:05:52,111 --> 00:05:54,111
When I am doing good,

59
00:05:54,111 --> 00:05:59,596
I can make 400-500
haitian dollars a day.

60
00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:06,086
It was my uncle who introduced me to
the craft, he taught me how to catch fish.

61
00:06:06,086 --> 00:06:12,056
Nowadays when I am on my own, I learned
much more and I am more experienced.

62
00:06:14,928 --> 00:06:18,906
I also trained to be a bricklayer,
to help with constructions.

63
00:06:18,906 --> 00:06:23,112
When I am not out on the sea,
I work as a construction worker,

64
00:06:23,112 --> 00:06:25,340
to earn a living.

65
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:35,178
There are days when the sea is rough,
then it's hard, we have no work.

66
00:06:35,178 --> 00:06:36,969
That's why I work on constructions.

67
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:39,790
It is not easy to be a fisherman,
on Haiti.

68
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,109
Life on Haiti is hard.

69
00:06:42,109 --> 00:06:45,181
To take care of oneself and a family.

70
00:06:55,694 --> 00:07:01,089
When I am on the sea, I work hard.
I am here every day.

71
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:03,985
I sail the sea every single day.

72
00:07:03,985 --> 00:07:08,770
Sometimes I catch fish,
sometimes nothing at all.

73
00:07:09,369 --> 00:07:17,672
Here in Baie de Henne
the sea is everything we have.

74
00:07:18,265 --> 00:07:25,502
Without working on the sea,
we have nothing to do,

75
00:07:25,502 --> 00:07:27,548
and we have nothing.

76
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:32,608
When the nets are empty,
or the fish is no good to eat.

77
00:07:32,608 --> 00:07:36,067
we have to go out again and again.

78
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:45,060
A while back we have had a rough time
due to the weather.

79
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:50,347
We are still sorting out the mess,
it caused us great damages.

80
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:08,480
Republic of Haiti
is one of the Great Antilles islands.

81
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,520
After Dominican Republic and Cuba,

82
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,480
it is the third largest
country in the Caribbean Sea.

83
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:21,480
Haiti, is considered to be the poorest
country in the western hemisphere.

84
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,080
The journey
to this unfortunate primacy

85
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,600
through a bloody history

86
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,160
and a series of misfortunes,

87
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:35,120
led Haitians on the very edge
of the civilized world.

88
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,640
As early as 5000 years ago

89
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,400
the island was inhabited
by the indigenous people of Taínos.

90
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:49,640
Their simple and peacefull existince
in the tropical paradise

91
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,800
was disrupted when a ship named Santa María

92
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:59,280
run aground on the Northern
part of the island in 1492.

93
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,080
Christopher Columbus,
who in his early journeys

94
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,200
had only anchored in the Bahamas and Cuba

95
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,840
named the island Hispaniola.

96
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,160
As the name suggests,
it then belonged to the Spanish crown.

97
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,480
Following a friendly welcome,

98
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,880
he left there a part of his crew

99
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,840
and founded the first settlement
in the new found world.

100
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,440
We distribute
milk before the school starts every day.

101
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,200
This is a project
that we got from Aries, France.

102
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,560
The use of this milk is
very very important for this place

103
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,680
because many
of our children come to school

104
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,960
without eating or drinking

105
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:16,240
and earlier what is to
happen is to have children,

106
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,960
who is to faint fall in the class,

107
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,920
even during assembly.

108
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,520
And this is what made us look
for a project that will help our children.

109
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,160
Since two yers we are
distributing milk for the children

110
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,680
and since we start to
distributing milk, we never had any case of

111
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,040
children falling,
fainting and things like that.

112
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,000
Otherwise, many used to
come and say, I have stomach aches.

113
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,760
Actually, it is not a
stomach ache, it is hunger.

114
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,360
So this is a problem
that we are trying to solve

115
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,320
to a great extent by helping
these children have this cup of milk.

116
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,400
There are some who don't want it,

117
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,480
but most majority
of the children have it in the morning.

118
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,960
Some want a little bit, someone more.

119
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:09,440
According to their need, according
to their desire saw milk in the school.

120
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,040
Since 2006

121
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,080
I have been visting this place

122
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,880
and I have seen many children,
that were not in school.

123
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,720
With the permission of our mother superior,

124
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,920
I requested
to open a small school for poor children.

125
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,000
A convent used to be here

126
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,840
between 2004 - 2010.

127
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,920
But the earthquake had come
that destroyed everything.

128
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,520
Both the house of the
sisters and the school.

129
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,080
We couldn't stay in the ruins after the
earthquake, with all the young people.

130
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,160
We have seven young sister
that accompanied us outside.

131
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,440
Every night
we used to go to vacant land nearby

132
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,840
and we spent the night together
with other people

133
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,240
from demolished places.

134
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,320
We stayed there for 2 weeks

135
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:20,480
and in the end we decided
to built tents in this yard.

136
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:29,040
Between 2010 and 2013,

137
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,240
we had a small housing
and the main tent here.

138
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,040
And our friendly organization

139
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:45,920
help us find charity supporters,
that have built this community.

140
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,920
Caritas Slovakia

141
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:55,120
visited us
and then heled us build

142
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,720
four classrooms and restroom facilities
to accommodate all the children.

143
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,240
Since that
the school works perfectly

144
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,520
We now have 495 students,

145
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,240
children in the preschool,
and elementary school.

146
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:20,360
and we hope that we will continue
in the philoshy of this community.

147
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,480
A girraffe...

148
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,240
who will show me a girraffe?

149
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,720
What does a girraffe look like?

150
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,800
Correct!!!

151
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,200
And who will show me a lion?

152
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,640
Hello,

153
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,040
dear children and dear teachers,

154
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,040
We are very happy,

155
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,880
that can visit you
this year.

156
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,120
It is with our great pleasure

157
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,320
to be here with you and the sisters

158
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,120
in the school of St. Jospeh.

159
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,560
We bring many greetings
from Caritas Czech Republic.

160
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,840
We hope that
you will do well this school year.

161
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,240
and have a great success,

162
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:35,840
beacause you
are the future of this land.

163
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,360
We pray for you and wish you

164
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,520
let the good protect you.

165
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,560
Thank you very much and enjoy your day.

166
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,400
Thank you.

167
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,080
Continual colonization ment a distaster
for the natives.

168
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,840
Their exploitation
used especially to discover gold.

169
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:32,720
Together with european diseases.

170
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,200
Causing that in just 40 years

171
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,080
the natives had become extinct.

172
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,800
The natives, as the workforce

173
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,280
were soon replaced

174
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,920
by the brought african slaves.

175
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,080
While the colonists

176
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,080
in the pursue for gold on the
American soil had started to leave,

177
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:58,760
French pirates started
to settle on the island.

178
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,160
A small isle
had become their shelther

179
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,960
by the northern coast.

180
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,840
named Tortuga.

181
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,400
The main role of the priest
is to help people with findinng God

182
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,200
a to meet with the Christ
through his Word.

183
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,680
It doesn't mean
just to deliver the Word.

184
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,840
but also to help them grow.

185
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,400
So apart the pastoral mission I have,
in this parish,

186
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,200
I also have a social mission.

187
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,960
I also help people
to improve their living standards.

188
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,520
When you look at the houses,

189
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:26,040
they are old houses,

190
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,080
as in the times of slaves and natives.

191
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,640
There is no sufficient infrastruscture
and the state level.

192
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,080
The government is almost non present.

193
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,600
Let me go back to Baie-de-Henne,

194
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,960
there are many children,
that can't go to school.

195
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,160
But those who have the luck,

196
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,680
will then stay home and leave the school.

197
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,000
Why?
Beacuse they don't have money.

198
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,800
I often go fishing,

199
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:08,240
I fish with my brother Wedline

200
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,320
to earn something extra

201
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,520
you understand?

202
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,520
Because my parents
don't have enough money

203
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:26,440
so I am trying to help them this way.

204
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,800
Everytime we have a holiday,

205
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:35,000
we try to help as we can,

206
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,960
so we go fishing.

207
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,640
Be standing in the corner
that is nothing for me.

208
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:50,000
Nothing for me.

209
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,720
Whe the school term allows to,

210
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,360
we work.
And when the holiday is over,

211
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,080
we go back to school.

212
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,400
So it is you,

213
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,320
that help this school to most

214
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,920
and I think it is you with the
support of people in Czech Republic

215
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,520
can help our young grow.

216
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,400
The Substitue Family Care Project
for me

217
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,720
is very unique.

218
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,920
It gave me a lot of hope.

219
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,200
You've become partners for me,

220
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,280
and helped me be diligiten
in my studies

221
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,840
get better
and do the best I can

222
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,440
and can excel in school.

223
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,320
Everytime,

224
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,600
when the school terms come,
I am happy.

225
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,240
I think about my god mother,

226
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,560
that sends me money,
so I can my books

227
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,800
and pay for studies for the term.

228
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,520
It was awesome

229
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,280
and it helped me very much.

230
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,000
Dear godmother,
I send you greetings my Grandmother,

231
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,880
I am thankful, that I can write this letter
to you.

232
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,360
Tell me what's new,
how are you, what do you do

233
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,320
and how is your health?

234
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,840
Everything is great here,
thanks God.

235
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,160
 How is your family?

236
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,080
I'd like to thank you,
for everything you keep sending me.

237
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,560
I'd like to become a diplomat.

238
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:45,360
I love you very much.
Thanks for the wonderful presents.

239
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,800
Your God-doughter, Desilise Viola,

240
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,320
sending you hugs and wishes
for great success.

241
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,360
From Desilise Violdy to the Godmother.

242
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,720
Baei-de-Henne

243
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:05,760
Do you know, why children leave
the school of St. Maria Goretti?

244
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,840
Because they have difficulty
keeping up in school,

245
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,040
because they don't work enough.

246
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,960
Every children that leaves
the school of St. Maria Goretti,

247
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,360
are excluded from the Substitue family
care program,

248
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,440
and can't return.

249
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,160
Do you see?

250
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,520
Because children

251
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,720
that have not tried enough, and lost
the option of being in the programe,

252
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,960
did not appreciate that your sponsor,

253
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,160
must make a significant efforts
within the programme

254
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,240
to be able to pay for the school

255
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,200
they have to be modest at home.

256
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,440
It is a great chance,
for you in the program.

257
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,520
When you don't try enough,

258
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,280
you lose the chance for a better life.

259
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,520
You have to study

260
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,360
to have good grades

261
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,560
a can stay
both in the programe,

262
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:02,280
and the school of St. Maria Goretti.

263
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,480
To work with children

264
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,280
is a pleasure and joy.

265
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,800
I live for them.

266
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,720
I stay with them
especially every night,

267
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,760
when we prepare to sleep.

268
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,760
I tell them jokes
before they go sleep.

269
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,520
I love children, I live with them.

270
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:34,480
Everytime I leave home,
when I know I will see them

271
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,080
it is a happines, a pure happiness.

272
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,680
Their hugs.

273
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,920
Children love teachers.

274
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,320
They don't always have father at home,
Nemají vždycky doma tatínky,

275
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,880
but when they feel the presence of a man,

276
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,560
it helps them experience they have one.

277
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,960
It is a luck being with the children.

278
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,960
But we have people,

279
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,800
that want to move, leave the country.

280
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,560
That is a problem.

281
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,080
But when we do something

282
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,600
that we love,
we don't have problems.

283
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,920
We feel good
and feel success,

284
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,120
perfect happiness.

285
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,600
Especially with the children.

286
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,680
When we prepare some activities
with the students,

287
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:50,240
we see children dance,
sing, recite poetry and so.

288
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,560
It is wonderful.

289
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,360
If we had an auditorium,

290
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:58,800
where children could perform

291
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:03,960
that could be a great thing
for the community,

292
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,120
the faith could spread there

293
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,640
through the education or
cultural activities.

294
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,560
We also now,
that our children become adults

295
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,600
and will contributing
in the future of this country.

296
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,520
We will see,

297
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,520
had the chance to be a part of
their growing up.

298
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,320
It's wort it.

299
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:18,320
We often bring bad news about Haiti
to the world

300
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,720
and a bad image,

301
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,640
but there are good things on Haiti.

302
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,160
Our situation can
often be seen as bad

303
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,120
in the media,

304
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,160
but there good things here.

305
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,880
There are also
that enjoy their work,

306
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,720
that like to welcome guests.

307
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,480
We can't just accept

308
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,520
what is said, what we hear
on the radio or in the television.

309
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,680
but we also need experience
with loving a neighbour.

310
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:52,600
especially the people
of Baie-de-Henne.

311
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,760
Haiti is not only
and poverty and suffering.

312
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,800
Come visit us,

313
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,240
so you can discover

314
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:17,200
a taste Haiti, experience the
love of people in Baie-de-Henne,

315
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,640
that always have their smile,
character

316
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,560
and love to all people of goodwill.

317
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,040
Everyone is after me.

318
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,480
We are here with the dudes

319
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,840
The sunset is absolutely epic.

320
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,120
The others are on the beach.

321
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,320
...

322
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,880
Three, two, one..

323
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,960
The growing influx
of French settlers.

324
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,880
on the western half of the island,

325
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,240
culminated with the end of 17th century

326
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,400
in division of the Hispaniola
into two parts.

327
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,920
Unlike the eastern, Spanish half

328
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:29,600
the French one experienced
an unseen growth.

329
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,720
 the sugar cane platnations,

330
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,320
helped the Saint-Domingue,

331
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,400
become the richest French colony.

332
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:41,400
It went in hand with
increasing use of slave work

333
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,200
and rapidly growing
slave trade

334
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,600
from many places in Africa.

335
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,480
By the end of the 18th century,

336
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,320
The half of a milion
of slaves brought from Africa,

337
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,800
make up 90% of the population
on the island.

338
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:00,040
Next to the the most populous,
enslaved group of inhabitant,

339
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,000
lived a rich white class

340
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,640
of so called the big whites,

341
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,400
not so rich class of small whites,

342
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,880
then mulattos
mulatů

343
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,400
and also freed or redeemed slaves.

344
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,960
Food for the Poor
is an organization that helps

345
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:44,840
a lot of other
small organizations in Haiti.

346
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,560
When we have
a program, if we need something,

347
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,840
we can always ask them
and usually they provide us

348
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,320
with what they have.

349
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,280
2017... 2017?

350
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,720
2017...

351
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:03,760
We got a lot of medicine,
both most of them have an experation

352
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,400
in only one or two months.

353
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,400
We can't use them all in that time.

354
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,920
We use some during a week

355
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,160
but the rest stays with the nurses.

356
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,680
They can give it to other people

357
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,840
but it is all to be expired within a month.

358
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,240
So it's like instant coffee.

359
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,200
You get instant medicine,
which cannot be used after.

360
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:34,040
I volunteered to come to Haiti
because I had known the mission of Haiti

361
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,840
well earlier,
I had been responsible for the projects,

362
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:42,920
construction projects here
and I had worked on every year almost.

363
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,320
I had visited Haiti.

364
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,320
There was a deep longing within me

365
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,920
to live here,
to be with the people, because I felt

366
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,480
there was a greater need
where I could make myself useful.

367
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,600
For me what I would say is...

368
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:04,080
It's very difficult
to explain what Haiti is.

369
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,320
You need to come
and experience it yourselves

370
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:13,640
because the situation
here, if you are living in Europe,

371
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,120
you cannot
imagine the lives of people here

372
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:22,960
because they are some 50 years
backward, 100 years, I would say backward.

373
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,880
Well, most of the
people speak about Haiti

374
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,120
they speak about the rich people.

375
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,400
They did speak about wealth

376
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:35,320
you see TV, television
programs, all beautiful places

377
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,640
where there
are big hotels and the beaches.

378
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,960
Where rich people are.

379
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,960
But this forgotten poor people,
nobody shows them in the television. No.

380
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,960
You don't see any programs
of this, but there are lots of the people

381
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,120
whom we serve here in the center

382
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,760
are theforgotten
people of Haiti I would say.

383
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,680
They have no houses,

384
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,600
there are no jobs.

385
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,560
They are ready
to come to the center for nutrition

386
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:06,760
and you see from morning, 9:00
till 12:00, they'll sit to get that food.

387
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,480
It is food that matters for them

388
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,640
and it's a pathetic condition

389
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,280
it's terrible,

390
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,520
but yet we need to support them

391
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,680
we need to stand by them.

392
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,400
This is a house
where we have rented it.

393
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,840
We have rented
one room for this family.

394
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,360
You can come and see the family.

395
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,320
Have a look at the house.

396
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,120
You see the houses
around here all houses around

397
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,040
there are quite a number of houses
that we have built here in this village

398
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,520
with the help of
the money that charitas Olomouc

399
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:07,560
given us also
and this is a big need here

400
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,240
because there are
lots of people who are homeless.

401
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,800
They don't have houses.

402
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,200
So therefore,
this has helped us a lot

403
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,400
to help these people.

404
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,320
It is because this is a quite
poor area.

405
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,000
that's why we organizujeme
this medical camp

406
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,360
every year, for the children
of the St. Maria Goretti school.

407
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,400
So therefore
we tried to do what we can for

408
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,840
this group of
people who are with us,

409
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,080
this type
of people who are with us.

410
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,720
There are people who are well-to-do

411
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,080
who are in the town.

412
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,160
They send their
children to better schools.

413
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,880
But as children
who cannot afford to go to schools

414
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,760
they come here to our school.

415
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,880
And we try to get
some help from other organizations

416
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,160
and to run the school

417
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,600
for the benefit
of all these poor people.

418
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,600
Quite social tension
and the resentment of slaves

419
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:50,560
soon stirred up
events in the continental France.

420
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,720
Conflicits between population groups
on the island

421
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,840
driven by the idea of the
Great French Revolution

422
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:02,760
benefited to the group of enslaved,
who rebelled in 1791

423
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:07,320
a achieved
the most successful slave rebellion.

424
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,320
on the american continent.

425
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,560
Their leader,
Toussaint Loverture

426
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,040
successfully fought
against local populations of

427
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,720
Spanish and English people

428
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,680
and suprisingly
also against mulattos.

429
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:25,920
Altough he did not succeed
against the Emperor Napoleon,

430
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,000
who won back
the rebelled colony,

431
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,200
his successors

432
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,520
in the end managed to
drive French out of the island,

433
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,720
vyvraždit zbylé
bělošské obyvatelstvo

434
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,040
and declare the Republic of Haiti
in 1804.

435
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,120
The work I do,

436
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,000
I took it over my father,

437
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,520
who brought me in,

438
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,320
before he died.

439
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,480
When he passed away,
I took over the job.

440
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,760
I build coffins,
used for transport to the chapel,

441
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,320
which is across here,

442
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,640
and for burrial on the cemetery.
a pro uložení na hřbitově.

443
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,280
The first contract I had,

444
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:28,080
was a coffion for a ten
year old child.

445
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,680
That was a though experience
right in the beginning.

446
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,200
When everything goes well,
every week,

447
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,400
we can complete four coffins.

448
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,000
But you know,

449
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,960
as the time goes,
we modernize the process.

450
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,240
So to built a single coffin

451
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:17,000
takes us less and less time.

452
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,200
I don't work for people
from the big cities,

453
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,720
they pay up to 500-100
Haitian gourde

454
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:33,320
(3,65 - 7,30 USD)

455
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,680
Here, I get around 30
Haitian gourde. (0,22 USD)

456
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,920
I don't get away with much here.

457
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,720
Making a livelihood with this craft
used to be much easier,

458
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,520
but now..

459
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,680
People want to work,
but there is no work.

460
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,920
Growing plants takes long,

461
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,600
we don't see much rain here.

462
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,960
It is a big, a really big problem.

463
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,720
Everything is expensive
for people

464
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,760
and they push prices down.

465
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,240
That's how it is around here.

466
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,000
When there is nothing

467
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,160
there is no action.

468
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,840
No action.

469
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,760
We take it as it is.

470
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,400
There is not..

471
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,360
There is not much we can do.

472
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,120
Nothing we can do.

473
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:28,711
Haiti became the first non-African
African-descendant state,

474
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,080
but for the next hundred years,
it was plagued by internal unrest

475
00:40:33,842 --> 00:40:35,343
and political instability,

476
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,221
poverty, destitution, illiteracy,
and isolation.

477
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:49,304
Over a century of chaos was temporarily
ended by intervention of the United States.

478
00:40:49,552 --> 00:40:54,302
Although the twenty-year occupation
primarily protected American interests,

479
00:40:55,422 --> 00:40:59,002
it brought about various
advances in civilization and efforts

480
00:40:59,752 --> 00:41:03,002
to define the Haitian identity.

481
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,600
Transportation is diffictult on Haiti.

482
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,480
The traffic is heavy,

483
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,240
and we don't have proper roads.

484
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,640
It's really tough.

485
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,320
But I drive anyway..

486
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,960
I do my best.

487
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,440
People over here are terrible drivers.

488
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:08,520
Some drive in the right lane,
others on the left side.

489
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,200
Everyone should be
driving in the right lane.

490
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:19,520
This brings trouble, many troubles.

491
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:25,280
We have a lot of car crashes,
many fatal too.

492
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,120
There is no police,

493
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,360
to watch over the traffic
on Haiti.

494
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,600
People just drive as they want.

495
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,440
To make a some money,

496
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,760
I drive people from one place
to another.

497
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,400
From one to another and back.

498
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,600
I am also a mechanic,

499
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,680
but that requires
many tools.

500
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,320
And I don't have a workshop.

501
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,880
I have no...

502
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,000
no place where I could work.

503
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,920
That's just..

504
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,200
life on Haiti.

505
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,760
I can't do my work...

506
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,440
without tools.

507
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,680
And I don't even
have enough customers.

508
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,160
There are no customers.

509
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,600
I am doing so-so.

510
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,520
When we left the airport..

511
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,320
it was just dirt and dust...

512
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:33,600
people selling fruits and vegetables,
on the streets..

513
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,960
oh and traffic jams.

514
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:39,840
Traffic jams that are a daily
routine here in the capital.

515
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:43,720
when you need to travel somewhere,
you usually spend the whole day in jams,

516
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,840
There are no traffic rules.

517
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,680
It is interesting,
on Haiti signs don't show the distance

518
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,680
but the time of travel.

519
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:29,200
We are now in Môle-Saint-Nicolas

520
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:35,520
This village is called Môle-Saint-Nicolas
and it was here

521
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,680
that people first set foot on our land.

522
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,320
When Christopher Columbus

523
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:46,760
searched for spices

524
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:50,480
he had discovered a new land,
that is now called Haiti.

525
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:09,480
When they landed,
their crew camped here

526
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,120
and founded a stronghold.

527
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,480
This place is full of traces
of Christopher Columbus.

528
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:54,120
Around 2012,

529
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:59,080
I met with my friend Julien,
he wanted to take up kitesurfing.

530
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,520
in the Dominican Republic.
I went into it with him.

531
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:06,000
Finally he brought me to this place.

532
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,760
It was my goal to return to Haiti,

533
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,760
work here and promote kitesurfing.

534
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,800
It was perfect for me.

535
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:35,680
I hope to help promote and develop
kitesurfing on Haiti in future.

536
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:40,000
It is big attraction for people
who come from different countries.

537
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,320
Not for those who live here.

538
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:27,040
I'd like to see more people,
maybe Europeans,

539
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,880
to come here and discover
beautiful beaches,

540
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:34,640
this wonderful country
that we have here.

541
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:42,640
It is just great to visit
and enjoy some adventure.

542
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,960
This palm,
that Stenley planted himself.

543
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:57,880
His gardening accomplishment.

544
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:12,840
I am planting my coconut tree

545
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:15,160
It takes around 10 year,

546
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,640
but when it grows,
I have my palm here on Haiti,

547
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:20,080
so I can just stop by here,
eat my coconuts.

548
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,840
So after the coconuts,
we now have sticky fingers from sugar cane.

549
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:29,400
Shall we have some more sugar cane?

550
00:50:06,321 --> 00:50:13,572
After the Americans left in 1934, the
country returned to political instability.

551
00:50:14,322 --> 00:50:21,722
The succession of dictators ended in 1957
with one - François Duvalier.

552
00:50:22,443 --> 00:50:28,692
The rural doctor known as Papa Doc ruled
through a violent and repressive regime

553
00:50:28,716 --> 00:50:32,891
and further deepened the
endless spiral of Haitian poverty.

554
00:50:32,942 --> 00:50:39,442
of social disparities and deliberately
disrupted social bonds and solidarity.

555
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:46,802
After the revolution in 1986
that overthrew his successor-son,

556
00:50:46,802 --> 00:50:50,302
the carousel of unrest
spun again,

557
00:50:50,802 --> 00:50:55,051
with violent coups and
military dictatorships.

558
00:50:55,552 --> 00:51:01,502
And if the unstable political situation
is combined with trembeling earth

559
00:51:01,752 --> 00:51:06,252
as in the case of the
catastrophic 2010 earthquake,

560
00:51:06,501 --> 00:51:09,502
which claimed the lives of several
hundred thousand people,

561
00:51:10,502 --> 00:51:13,501
the escape from the vicious cycle
of poverty and the country's

562
00:51:13,501 --> 00:51:18,752
dependency on humanitarian aid
becomes even more distant.

563
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:35,240
If..

564
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,440
I am to...

565
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,120
compare

566
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,920
life on Haiti

567
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,920
and in Czech Republic

568
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:50,920
is a totally,
a completely different life.

569
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,920
I think in Czech Republic

570
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,360
there are roads built

571
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,680
In Czech Republic

572
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,440
there are big

573
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,560
supermarkets,

574
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,240
big

575
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,040
businesses.

576
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,760
Large factories,

577
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:16,760
big economists,

578
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,720
that do their work.

579
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:20,560
There are also..

580
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,480
people,

581
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,120
with resources.

582
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,120
They build

583
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:32,640
houses and created

584
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,080
work places,
so people of Czech Republic can work.

585
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,320
Young people in Czech Republic

586
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,560
have it much easier to find work.

587
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,960
They have food,

588
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,080
they have drinking water.

589
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:50,600
They have everything

590
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:54,160
that we need.

591
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,880
On Haiti

592
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:00,080
we don't have much.

593
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,960
No roads,

594
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:06,200
no electricity,

595
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,160
we don't have

596
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,120
supermarkets.

597
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:14,840
We don't have

598
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,400
large companies.

599
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:22,640
We don't have companies
to give us a job.

600
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,400
But Haiti is my home

601
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,040
and I love my country.

602
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:31,520
There are many interesting places to visit.

603
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:36,080
We have our nature,
it is really wonderful.

604
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,680
Tourists that come to Haiti,

605
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,400
they don't want to go back home,

606
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,920
beacuse it's so lovely here.

607
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,840
We are beginning,

608
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:52,680
but our country is poor.

609
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:56,720
We don't have enough natural resources.

610
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:00,960
We don't even have
proper agriculture.

611
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,320
We have no work.

612
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:08,040
98% of people on Haiti

613
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,760
have no job.

614
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:15,000
We have 60 % students,

615
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:17,440
that finished the secondary school,

616
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,880
but can't continue to university.

617
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,480
We have..

618
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,120
we have..

619
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:27,040
students,

620
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:31,520
that have finished secondary education,
but have nothing to do.

621
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,400
And they leave the country

622
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:34,960
they go to Chile,

623
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:36,640
Dominican Republic

624
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,240
or Brasil.

625
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:42,360
They go to foreign countries
to escape the poverty,

626
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,680
because on Haiti...

627
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,360
there is nothing to live on.

628
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:55,200
But I stay here,
because I love my country.

629
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:57,840
Haiti is a wonderful contry.

630
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:01,120
It is my country, my motherland.

631
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:04,560
It is a country of my father,

632
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:07,680
my mother
and mine too.

633
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,920
And I love it.

634
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:15,360
But there many things,
that need to change.

635
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,200
(Czech verb conjugation)
I drink.

636
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:31,600
You drink.

637
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,360
They drink.

638
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,320
We drink...

639
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:38,760
we drink.

640
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:40,800
You drink.

641
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:44,040
They drink.

642
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:57,920
That's it.

643
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,400
Thank you very much!
