1
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:22,560
A major earthquake shook
the Caribbean nation of Haiti late today.

2
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:26,360
It hit just 14 miles
from the capital city Port-au-Prince.

3
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:31,400
The U.S. Geological Survey
reported a magnitude of 7.0,

4
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:34,000
the largest ever
recorded in that region.

5
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:37,640
Reports said the presidential
palace and a hospital collapsed

6
01:00:37,880 --> 01:00:39,640
along with other buildings.

7
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:42,200
The president
and his wife escaped injury,

8
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,920
but thousands of other people
were killed or buried under rubble.

9
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:52,240
Magnitude 7.0 is the very
major quake and this one was shallow

10
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:56,760
and of course, you've noted
near a very large population center.

11
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:59,960
So we have,
unfortunately, the feeling

12
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,560
that this is going to be
a very devastating event.

13
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:05,320
It’s half day
right now, it's a dark mo...

14
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:08,800
I think it's one of
the darkest moments we've ever faced.

15
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,600
I was at home.

16
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:43,240
My house is made of wood.

17
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:52,120
and suddenly
is started shaking, very fiercely.

18
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:57,960
I laid down and my children did too.

19
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:00,880
We were all lying down on the floor.

20
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:06,680
It was only after the earthquake we got up.

21
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:11,040
I went outside and I saw

22
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:16,120
houses broken to pieces.

23
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:19,360
Many people died

24
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:25,440
and I started to scream, very loudly

25
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:27,640
"Oh my God

26
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:28,920
what is happening?

27
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,640
What is this?"

28
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:35,560
I have never seen anything like it before in my life.

29
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:40,040
Then I went to my neighbours'

30
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:46,240
to help them free people

31
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:51,280
who got stuck under debris

32
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:54,840
We were celebrating Eucharist 

33
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:59,240
that's when I felt earth movements.

34
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:03,240
Earth started to move
and I have said to the priest "Shall we go back home?

35
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:05,960
I have a feeling something bad is going to happen."

36
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:08,800
So we went back to this place

37
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:15,360
and we just watched
the house, the school, without moving. 

38
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,520
Luckily, we didn't stay inside,

39
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,320
we had time to get out and escape death.

40
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:29,760
There were people saying
"The end of the world is coming"

41
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,480
It was the first time 

42
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:37,200
we have found ourselves in a situation like this.

43
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:40,200
We didn't know this.

44
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:46,120
We have never seen an earthquake on Haiti,
this was the first.

45
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:52,560
People said:
"The God has returned, it is the day of reckoning."

46
00:04:53,491 --> 00:04:57,427
Sometimes the nets are empty, 
and the other day we catch four hundred fish.

47
00:04:57,427 --> 00:05:02,070
I get 800-100 Haiti Dollars
for that.

48
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:06,035
We keep some
and sell the rest.

49
00:05:06,035 --> 00:05:13,049
Sometimes it takes just an hour
to pull up the fishing net,

50
00:05:13,049 --> 00:05:19,060
but often you will need four hours.

51
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,527
It is a hard work,
and it takes time.

52
00:05:28,973 --> 00:05:30,850
It is unpredictable too.

53
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,406
Sometimes you catch a lot fish,
that's great.

54
00:05:34,406 --> 00:05:38,138
But you can also spend days, 

55
00:05:39,414 --> 00:05:42,737
with net set deep and still get nothing.

56
00:05:43,305 --> 00:05:48,952
But when you catch something you can sell,

57
00:05:48,952 --> 00:05:52,111
it provides some means of livelihood.

58
00:05:52,111 --> 00:05:54,111
When I am doing good,

59
00:05:54,111 --> 00:05:59,596
I can make 400-500
haitian dollars a day.

60
00:06:02,066 --> 00:06:06,086
It was my uncle who introduced me to the craft,
he taught me how to catch fish.

61
00:06:06,086 --> 00:06:12,056
Nowadays when I am on my own,
I learned much more and I have more experience.

62
00:06:14,928 --> 00:06:18,906
I also trained to be a bricklayer,
to help with constructions.

63
00:06:18,906 --> 00:06:23,112
When I am not out on the sea,
I work as a construction worker,

64
00:06:23,112 --> 00:06:25,340
to earn a living.

65
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:35,178
There are days when the sea is rough,
then it's hard, we have no work.

66
00:06:35,178 --> 00:06:36,969
That's why I work on constructions.

67
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:39,790
It is not easy to be a fisherman,
on Haiti.

68
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,109
Life on Haiti is hard.

69
00:06:42,109 --> 00:06:45,181
To take care of oneself and a family.

70
00:06:55,694 --> 00:07:01,089
When I am on the sea, I work hard.
I am here every day.

71
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:03,985
I sail the sea every single day.

72
00:07:03,985 --> 00:07:08,770
Sometimes I catch fish,
sometimes nothing at all.

73
00:07:09,369 --> 00:07:17,672
Here in Baie de Henne
the sea is everything we have.

74
00:07:18,265 --> 00:07:25,502
Without working on the sea,
we have nothing to do,

75
00:07:25,502 --> 00:07:27,548
and we have nothing.

76
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:32,608
When the nets are empty,
or the fish is no good to eat.

7
00:07:32,608 --> 00:07:36,067
we have to go out again and again.

78
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:45,060
A while back we have had a rough time
due to the weather.

79
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:50,347
We are still sorting out the mess,
it caused us great damages. 

80
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:08,480
Republic of Haiti
is one of the Great Antilles islands.

81
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,520
After Dominican Republic and Cuba,

82
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:15,480
it is the third largest
country in the Caribbean Sea.

83
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:21,480
Haiti, is considered to be
the poorest country in the western hemisphere.

84
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:25,080
The journey
to this unfortunate primacy

85
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:27,600
through a bloody history

86
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:30,160
and a series of misfortunes,

87
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:35,120
led Haitians on the very edge
of the civilized world.

88
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:38,640
As early as 5000 years ago

89
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:44,400
the island was inhabited
by the indigenous people of Taínos.

90
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:49,640
Their simple and peacefull existince
in the tropical paradise

91
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:52,800
was disrupted when a ship named Santa María

92
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:59,280
run aground on the Northern part of the island
in 1492.

93
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:04,080
Christopher Columbus,
who in his early journeys


94
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:06,200
had only anchored in the Bahamas and Cuba

95
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:09,840
named the island Hispaniola.

96
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:14,160
As the name suggests,
it then belonged to the Spanish crown.

97
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:17,480
Following a friendly welcome,

98
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:20,880
he left there a part of his crew

99
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:25,840
and founded the first settlement
in the new found world.

100
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:56,440
We distribute
milk before the school starts every day.

101
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:01,200
This is a project
that we got from Aries, France.

102
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:05,560
The use of this milk is
very very important for this place

103
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:08,680
because many
of our children come to school

104
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:10,960
without eating or drinking

105
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:16,240
and earlier what is to
happen is to have children,

106
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,960
who is to faint fall in the class,

107
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:20,920
even during assembly.

108
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:26,520
And this is what made us look
for a project that will help our children.

109
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:30,160
Since two yers we are
distributing milk for the children

110
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:35,680
and since we start to
distributing milk, we never had any case of

111
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:39,040
children falling,
fainting and things like that.

112
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:42,000
Otherwise, many used to
come and say, I have stomach aches.

113
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:44,760
Actually, it is not a
stomach ache, it is hunger.

114
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:49,360
So this is a problem
that we are trying to solve

115
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:53,320
to a great extent by helping
these children have this cup of milk.

116
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:57,400
There are some who don't want it,

117
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,480
but most majority
of the children have it in the morning.

118
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:04,960
Some want a little bit, someone more.

119
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:09,440
According to their need, according
to their desire saw milk in the school.

120
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:19,040
Since 2006

121
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:23,080
I have been visting this place

122
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:28,880
and I have seen many children,
that were not in school.

123
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:32,720
With the permission of our mother superior,

124
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:37,920
I requested
to open a small school for poor children.


125
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:41,000
A convent used to be here

126
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:44,840
between 2004 - 2010.

127
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:49,920
But the earthquake had come
that destroyed everything.

128
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:53,520
Both the house of the sisters and the school.

129
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:59,080
We couldn't stay in the ruins after the earthquake,
with all the young people.

130
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:02,160
We have seven young sister
that accompanied us outside.

131
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,440
Every night
we used to go to vacant land nearby

132
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:08,840
and we spent the night together
with other people

133
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,240
from demolished places.

134
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:14,320
We stayed there for 2 weeks

135
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:20,480
and in the end we decided
to built tents in this yard.

136
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:29,040
Between 2010 and 2013,

137
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:34,240
we had a small housing
and the main tent here.

138
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:38,040
And our friendly organization

139
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:45,920
help us find charity supporters,
that have built this community.

140
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:48,920
Caritas Slovakia

141
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:55,120
visited us
and then heled us build
142
01:12:55,680 --> 01:13:00,720
four classrooms and restroom facilities
to accommodate all the children.

143
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:04,240
Since that
the school works perfectly

144
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:09,520
We now have 495 students,

145
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:15,240
children in the preschool,
and elementary school. 

146
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:20,360
and we hope that we will continue
in the philoshy of this community.

147
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:25,480
A girraffe...

148
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:29,240
who will show me a girraffe?

149
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:33,720
What does a girraffe look like?

150
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,800
Correct!!!

151
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:40,200
And who will show me a lion?

152
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:02,640
Hello,

153
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:06,040
dear children and dear teachers,

154
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:09,040
We are very happy,

155
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:11,880
that can visit you
this year.

156
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:15,120
It is with our great pleasure

157
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:18,320
to be here with you and the sisters

158
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,120
in the school of St. Jospeh.

159
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:24,560
We bring many greetings
from Caritas Czech Republic.

160
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:27,840
We hope that
you will do well this school year.

161
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:32,240
and have a great success,

162
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:35,840
beacause you
are the future of this land.

163
01:16:36,160 --> 01:16:39,360
We pray for you and wish you

164
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:42,520
let the good protect you.

165
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,560
Thank you very much and enjoy your day.

166
01:16:45,960 --> 01:16:47,400
Thank you.

167
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:24,080
Continual colonization ment a distaster
for the natives.

168
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:28,840
Their exploitation
used especially to discover gold.

169
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:32,720
Together with european diseases.

170
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:35,200
Causing that in just 40 years

171
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:39,080
the natives had become extinct.

172
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:42,800
The natives, as the workforce

173
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:44,280
were soon replaced

174
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:46,920
by the brought african slaves.

175
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:50,080
While the colonists

176
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:54,080
in the pursue for gold
on the American soil
had started to leave,

177
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:58,760
French pirates started 
to settle on the island.

178
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:02,160
A small isle
had become their shelther 

179
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:03,960
by the northern coast.

180
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:05,840
named Tortuga.

181
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:14,400
The main role of the priest
is to help people with findinng God

182
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:19,200
a to meet with the Christ
through his Word.

183
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,680
It doesn't mean
just to deliver the Word.

184
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:24,840
but also to help them grow. 

185
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:28,400
So apart the pastoral mission I have,
in this parish,

186
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,200
I also have a social mission.

187
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:32,960
I also help people
to improve their living standards.
188
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:23,520
When you look at the houses,

189
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:26,040
they are old houses,

190
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:29,080
as in the times of slaves and natives.

191
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:33,640
There is no sufficient infrastruscture
and the state level.
192
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,080
The government is almost non present.

193
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,600
Let me go back to Baie-de-Henne,

194
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:43,960
there are many children,
that can't go to school.

195
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:48,160
But those who have the luck,

196
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:50,680
will then stay home and leave the school. 

197
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:55,000
Why?
Beacuse they don't have money.

198
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:00,800
I often go fishing,

199
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:08,240
I fish with my brother Wedline

200
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:13,320
to earn something extra
201
01:20:14,040 --> 01:20:15,520
you understand?

202
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:20,520
Because my parents
don't have enough money

203
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:26,440
so I am trying to help them this way.

204
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:30,800
Everytime we have a holiday,

205
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:35,000
we try to help as we can,

206
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,960
so we go fishing.

207
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:43,640
Be standing in the corner is nothing for me.

208
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:50,000
Nothing for me.

209
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:52,720
Whe the school term allows to,

210
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:57,360
we work.
And when the holiday is over,

211
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:59,080
we go back to school.

212
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:02,400
So it is you,

213
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:07,320
that help this school to most

214
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:11,920
and I think it is you
with the support of people in Czech Republic

215
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:15,520
can help our young grow.

216
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:19,400
The Substitue Family Care Project
for me

217
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,720
is very unique.

218
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,920
It gave me a lot of hope.

219
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:28,200
You've become partners for me,

220
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:31,280
and helped me be diligiten
in my studies

221
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:36,840
get better
and do the best I can

222
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:40,440
and can excel in school.

223
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:42,320
Everytime,

224
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:45,600
when the school terms come,
I am happy.

225
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:49,240
I think about my god mother,

226
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:53,560
that sends me money,
so I can my books

227
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:56,800
and pay for studies for the term.

228
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:58,520
It was awesome

229
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:01,280
and it helped me very much.

230
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:18,000
Dear godmother,
Drahá kmotro,
I send you greetings my Grandmother,

231
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,880
I am pleased,
that I can write you this letter.

232
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:26,360
Tell me what's new,
how are you, what do you do

233
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:28,320
and how is your health?

234
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:31,840
Everything is great,
thanks God.

235
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:34,160
How is your family,

236
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:38,080
I'd like to thank you,
for everything you keep sending me.

237
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:41,560
I'd like to become a diplomat.

238
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:45,360
I love you very mich.
Thanks for the wonderful presents.

239
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,800
Your Godmother, Desilise Viola, 

240
01:22:48,080 --> 01:22:50,320
sending you hugs and wishes
for great success.

241
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:53,360
From Desilise Violdy to the Godmother.

242
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:54,720
Baei-de-Henne

243
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:05,760
Do you know, why children leave
the school of St. Maria Goretti

244
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:08,840
Because they have difficulty
keeping up in school,

245
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,040
because they don't work enough.

246
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:14,960
Every children that leaves
the school of St. Maria Goretti,

247
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:17,360
are excluded from the Substitue family
care program,

248
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:21,440
and can't return.

249
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:23,160
Do you see?

250
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:24,520
Because children

251
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:27,720
that have not tried enough,
and lost the option of being in the programe,

252
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:29,960
did not appreciate that your sponsor,

253
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:32,160
must make a significant efforts
within the programme

254
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,240
to be able to pay for the school

255
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:37,200
they have to be modest at home.

256
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:40,440
It is great chance,
for you in the program.

257
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:43,520
When you don't try enough,

258
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:46,280
you lose the chance for a better life.

259
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:49,520
You have to study

260
01:23:49,720 --> 01:23:54,360
to have good grades

261
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:57,560
a can stay
both in the programe,

262
01:23:57,560 --> 01:24:02,280
and the school of St. Maria Goretti.

263
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:10,480
To work with children

264
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:13,280
is a pleasure and joy.

265
01:24:13,960 --> 01:24:15,800
I live for them.

266
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:18,720
I stay with them
especially every night,

267
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,760
when we prepare to sleep.

268
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:25,760
I tell them jokes
before they go sleep.

269
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:29,520
I love children, I live with them.

270
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:34,480
Everytime I leave home,
when I know I will see them

271
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:37,080
it is a happines, a pure happiness.

272
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:41,680
Their hugs.

273
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:44,920
Children love teachers.

274
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:50,320
They don't always have father at home,
Nemají vždycky doma tatínky,

275
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:53,880
but when they feel the presence of a man,

276
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,560
it helps them experience they have one.

277
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:59,960
It is a luck being with the children.

278
01:25:24,440 --> 01:25:26,960
But we have people,

279
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:29,800
that want to move, leave the country.

280
01:25:30,520 --> 01:25:31,560
That is a problem.

281
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:33,080
But when we do something

282
01:25:33,080 --> 01:25:35,600
that we love, 
we don't have problems.

283
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,920
We feel good
and feel success,

284
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:39,120
perfect happiness.

285
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:40,600
Especially with the children.

286
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:43,680
When we prepare some activities
with the students,

287
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:50,240
we see children dance,
sing, recite poetry and so.

288
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:51,560
It is wonderful.

289
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:54,360
If we had an auditorium,
290
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:58,800
where children could perform

291
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:03,960
that could be a great thing
for the community,

292
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:07,120
the faith could spread there 

293
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:10,640
through the education or
cultural activities.

294
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:26,560
We also now,
that our children become adults

295
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:31,600
and will contributing
in the future of this country.

296
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:34,520
We will see,

297
01:26:34,520 --> 01:26:36,520
had the chance to be a part of
their growing up.

298
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,320
It's wort it.

299
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:18,320
We often bring bad news about Haiti
to the world

300
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:19,720
and a bad image,

301
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:21,640
but there are good things on Haiti.

302
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:24,160
Our situation can 
often be seen as bad

303
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:29,120
in the media,

304
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:32,160
but there good things here.

305
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:35,880
There are also
that enjoy their work,

306
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:38,720
that like to welcome guests.

307
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:40,480
We can't just accept

308
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:44,520
what is said, what we hear
on the radio or in the television.

309
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:48,680
but we also need experience
with loving a neighbour.

310
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:52,600
especially the people
of Baie-de-Henne.

311
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:07,760
Haiti is not only
and poverty and suffering.

312
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:09,800
Come visit us,

313
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:12,240
so you can discover

314
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:17,200
a taste Haiti,
experience the love of people in Baie-de-Henne,

315
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:21,640
that always have their smile,
character

316
01:28:22,760 --> 01:28:25,560
and love to all people of goodwill.

317
01:28:51,240 --> 01:28:53,040
Jsem na roztrhání!

318
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:57,480
Jsme tady s místnima borcema.

319
01:28:57,800 --> 01:28:59,840
Je úplně epický západ slunce.

320
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:01,120
A zbytek je na pláži.

321
01:29:01,120 --> 01:29:02,320
Zbytek je na plaži.

322
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,880
Tři, dva, jedna...

323
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:13,960
Vzrůstající příliv
Francouských osadníků

324
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:15,880
na západní polovině ostrova,

325
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:19,240
vyústil na konci 17. století

326
01:29:19,680 --> 01:29:22,400
v rozdělení
Hispanioly na dvě části.

327
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:25,920
Narodíl od
východní, Španělské části

328
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:29,600
prožívala Francouzská
polovina nebývalý rozmach.

329
01:29:29,920 --> 01:29:32,720
Především plantáže cukrové třtiny,

330
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:35,320
učinili z kolonie Saint-Domingue,

331
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:37,400
nejbohatší kolonii Francie.

332
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:41,400
S tím souviselo
i rozšíření práce otroků

333
01:29:41,680 --> 01:29:44,200
a jejich strmě vrůstající dovoz

334
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:46,600
z mnoha oblastí Afriky.

335
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:49,480
Ke konci 18. století,

336
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:52,320
tvořilo půl milionů černochů

337
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:55,800
devadesát
procent ostrovní populace.

338
01:29:56,560 --> 01:30:00,040
Vedle nejpočetnějšího,
nesvobodného obyvatelstva

339
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:03,000
zde žila bohatá vrstva bělochů,

340
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:05,640
tzv. velkých bílých,

341
01:30:05,920 --> 01:30:09,400
nepříliš majetná
bílá třída malých bílých,

342
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:10,880
mulatů

343
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:15,400
a rovněž osvobozených,
či vykoupených bývalých otroků

344
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:40,960
Food for the Poor
is an organization that helps

345
01:30:41,560 --> 01:30:44,840
a lot of other
small organizations in Haiti.

346
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:47,560
When we have
a program, if we need something,

347
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:50,840
we can always ask them
and usually they provide us

348
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:52,320
with what they have.

349
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:58,280
2017... 2017?

350
01:30:58,280 --> 01:30:59,720
2017...

351
01:31:00,280 --> 01:31:03,760
Dostali jsme spoustu
léku, ale většina z nich má trvanlivost

352
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:05,400
jenom jeden nebo až dva měsíce.

353
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:11,400
Všechny léky se nestačí
během jednoho nebo dvou měsícu použít.

354
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:14,920
Některé
použijeme během toho týdne

355
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:17,160
ale zbytek sestrám zůstane.

356
01:31:17,160 --> 01:31:18,680
Ony je mohou dát dalším lidem

357
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,840
ale do měsíce všechno projde.

358
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:24,240
So it's like instant coffee.

359
01:31:24,240 --> 01:31:28,200
You get instant medicine,
which cannot be used after.

360
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:34,040
I volunteered to come to Haiti
because I had known the mission of Haiti

361
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:37,840
well earlier,
I had been responsible for the projects,

362
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:42,920
construction projects here
and I had worked on every year almost.

363
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:44,320
I had visited Haiti.

364
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:47,320
There was a deep longing within me

365
01:31:47,320 --> 01:31:50,920
to live here, 
to be with the people, because I felt

366
01:31:51,480 --> 01:31:55,480
there was a greater need
where I could make myself useful.

367
01:31:56,120 --> 01:31:58,600
For me what I would say is...

368
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:04,080
It's very difficult
to explain what Haiti is.

369
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:08,320
You need to come 
and experience it yourselves

370
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:13,640
because the situation
here, if you are living in Europe,

371
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:17,120
you cannot
imagine the lives of people here

372
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:22,960
because they are some 50 years
backward, 100 years, I would say backward.

373
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:25,880
Well, most of the
people speak about Haiti

374
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:28,120
they speak about the rich people.

375
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:30,400
They did speak about wealth

376
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:35,320
you see TV, television
programs, all beautiful places

377
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:38,640
where there
are big hotels and the beaches.

378
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:41,960
Where rich people are.

379
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:46,960
But this forgotten poor people,
nobody shows them in the television. No.

380
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:50,960
You don't see any programs
of this, but there are lots of the people

381
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:53,120
whom we serve here in the center

382
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:55,760
are theforgotten
people of Haiti I would say.

383
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:57,680
They have no houses,

384
01:32:58,160 --> 01:32:59,600
there are no jobs.

385
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:02,560
They are ready
to come to the center for nutrition

386
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:06,760
and you see from morning,
9:00 till 12:00, they'll sit to get that food.

387
01:33:07,400 --> 01:33:09,480
It is food that matters for them

388
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:12,640
and it's a pathetic condition

389
01:33:12,640 --> 01:33:14,280
it's terrible,

390
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:16,520
but yet we need to support them

391
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:18,680
we need to stand by them.

392
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:26,400
This is a house
where we have rented it.

393
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:28,840
We have rented
one room for this family.

394
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:32,360
You can come and see the family.

395
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:34,320
Have a look at the house.

396
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:56,120
You see the houses
around here all houses around

397
01:33:56,640 --> 01:34:00,040
there are quite a number of houses
that we have built here in this village

398
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:03,520
with the help of
the money that charitas Olomouc

399
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:07,560
given us also
and this is a big need here

400
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:10,240
because there are
lots of people who are homeless.

401
01:34:10,840 --> 01:34:12,800
They don't have houses.

402
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:15,200
So therefore,
this has helped us a lot

403
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:16,400
to help these people.

404
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:43,320
Jelikož tahle
oblast je poměrně chudá,

405
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:47,000
tak proto i my
tady organizujeme zdravotnický

406
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:50,360
kemp každý rok,
právě pro děti ze školy St. Maria Goretti.

407
01:35:10,360 --> 01:35:13,400
So therefore
we tried to do what we can for

408
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:15,840
this group of
people who are with us,

409
01:35:16,600 --> 01:35:19,080
this type
of people who are with us.

410
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:21,720
There are people who are well-to-do

411
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:23,080
who are in the town.

412
01:35:23,080 --> 01:35:25,160
They send their
children to better schools.

413
01:35:25,680 --> 01:35:28,880
But as children
who cannot afford to go to schools

414
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:30,760
they come here to our school.

415
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:34,880
And we try to get
some help from other organizations

416
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:37,160
and to run the school

417
01:35:37,160 --> 01:35:39,600
for the benefit
of all these poor people.

418
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:46,600
Dřímající napětí
a nespokojenost otroků

419
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:50,560
brzy rozdmýchali
události na francouzské pevnině.

420
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:53,720
Střety různých ostrovních skupin

421
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:56,840
za ideály
Velké francouzské revoluce

422
01:35:57,240 --> 01:36:02,760
využili roku 1791
ke zbouření černí nevolníci

423
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:07,320
a dosáhli vůbec
nejúspěšnějšího otrockého povstání

424
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:09,320
na americkém kontinentě.

425
01:36:09,720 --> 01:36:12,560
Jejich vůdce
Toussaint Loverture

426
01:36:12,760 --> 01:36:16,040
úspěšně bojoval
proti domácím bělochům,

427
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:18,720
Španělům, Angličanům

428
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:21,680
a překvapivě i proti mulatům.

429
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:25,920
Přestože sám neuspěl
v boji s císařem Napoleonem,

430
01:36:26,240 --> 01:36:30,000
který se snažil zpátky
podmanit vzbouřenou kolonii,

431
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,200
podařilo se jeho následovníkům

432
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:34,520
nakonec Francouze z ostrova vyhnat,

433
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:37,720
vyvraždit zbylé
bělošské obyvatelstvo

434
01:36:38,040 --> 01:36:41,040
a vyhlásit v roce
1804 republiku Haiti.

435
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:52,120
Práci, kterou dělám

436
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:55,000
jsem převzal po svém otci,

437
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:57,520
který mě do toho zasvětil,

438
01:36:57,560 --> 01:36:59,320
než zemřel.

439
01:37:00,040 --> 01:37:02,480
Když zemřel,
převzal jsem jeho práci.

440
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:07,760
Zhotovuji rakve
pro přepravu těla do kaple,

441
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:10,320
která je naproti,

442
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:11,640
a pro uložení na hřbitově.

443
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:23,280
První zakázka, kterou jsem měl

444
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:28,080
byla výroba rakve
pro malé dítě, kterému bylo 10 let.

445
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:29,680
To byla těžká
zkušenost na začátku.

446
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:02,200
Každý týden,
když to jde dobře,

447
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:04,400
tak vyrobíme čtyři rakve.

448
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:07,000
Ale víte jak,

449
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:11,960
časem se modernizuje
způsob kterým to děláme.

450
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:13,240
Na jednu rakev tedy 

451
01:38:13,640 --> 01:38:17,000
potřebujeme čím dál tím méně času.

452
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:27,200
Nepracuji pro lidi
ve velkých městech,

453
01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:29,720
kteří zaplatí za rakev

454
01:38:29,720 --> 01:38:33,320
klidně i 500-1000 haitských dolarů.
(75-150 Kč)

455
01:38:33,880 --> 01:38:36,680
Já pracuji tady,
kde dostanu tak 30 haitských dolarů (5 Kč)

456
01:38:37,640 --> 01:38:39,920
Nemůžu si
tady moc vyskakovat.

457
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:23,720
Dřív byla obživa
s tímto povoláním snažší,

458
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:25,520
ale teď...

459
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:28,680
Lidé chtějí
pracovat, ale práce není.

460
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:33,920
Cokoliv vypěstovat trvá dlouho,

461
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:36,600
protože často neprší.

462
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:38,960
To je velký,
opravdu velký problém.

463
01:39:39,560 --> 01:39:41,720
Potom lidem
připadá vše drahé

464
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:43,760
a tak tlačí ceny dolů.

465
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:49,240
Tady je to tak.

466
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:52,000
Kde nic není,

467
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:55,160
není ani žádná aktivita.

468
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:57,840
Žádná aktivita.

469
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:00,760
Musíme to tak brát.

470
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:02,400
Nedá se nic...

471
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:04,360
Nedá se nic dělat.

472
01:40:04,920 --> 01:40:06,120
Nedá se nic dělat.

473
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:24,600
S dopravou je to na Haiti těžkě.

474
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:27,480
Nejenom, že je tu hustý provoz,

475
01:41:28,760 --> 01:41:30,240
ale nejsou tady silnice.

476
01:41:31,600 --> 01:41:34,640
To je opravdu, opravdu těžké.

477
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:38,320
Ale i tak řídím...

478
01:41:38,320 --> 01:41:39,960
snažím se.

479
01:41:57,360 --> 01:42:00,440
Lidé zde řídí špatně.

480
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:08,520
Občas jední řídí
napravo a druzí nalevo.

481
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:12,200
Správně by
měli všichni řídit napravo...

482
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:19,520
To způsobuje
potíže, hodně potíží. 

483
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:25,280
Je tu hodně
nehod a mrtvých lidí.

484
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:27,120
Není tu policie,

485
01:42:27,120 --> 01:42:29,360
která by bděla
nad dopravou na Haiti.

486
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:32,600
Lidé si řídí, jak chtějí.

487
01:42:53,480 --> 01:42:55,440
Abych vydělal nějaké peníze,

488
01:42:55,960 --> 01:42:57,760
dopravuji lidi
z jedné zastávky na druhou.

489
01:43:00,440 --> 01:43:02,400
Z jedné zastávky na druhou.

490
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:06,600
Pracuji také jako mechanik,

491
01:43:09,200 --> 01:43:12,680
ale potřebuji
k tomu hodně nářadí.

492
01:43:12,680 --> 01:43:15,320
Navíc nemám místo.

493
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:17,880
Nemám...

494
01:43:20,280 --> 01:43:23,000
místo, kde bych mohl pracovat.

495
01:43:28,680 --> 01:43:29,920
Takový je...

496
01:43:30,920 --> 01:43:32,200
život na Haiti.

497
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:34,760
Nemohu dělat svou práci...

498
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:37,440
bez nářadí a také

499
01:43:38,120 --> 01:43:40,680
nemám ani dost zákazníků.

500
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:44,160
Nemám dost zákazníků.

501
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:48,600
Žiju jakžtakž.

502
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:25,520
Když jsme
vlastně vyjeli z letiště...

503
01:44:26,840 --> 01:44:28,320
všude špína, prach...

504
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:33,600
spousty lidí prodávajících
na ulici nejrůznější zeleninu, ovoce...

505
01:44:34,320 --> 01:44:35,960
a hlavně zácpy.

506
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:39,840
Zácpy, které jsou tady
v hlavním městě na denním pořádku,

507
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:43,720
pokud se chcete někam dostat,
tak většinou strávíte celý den v zácpách,

508
01:44:43,720 --> 01:44:45,840
nefungují tady žádná pravidla.

509
01:44:48,200 --> 01:44:51,680
A zajímavé je,
že na Haiti se neúdávají vzálenosti

510
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:53,680
v kilometrech, ale v hodinách.

511
01:45:26,680 --> 01:45:29,200
Nyní se nacházíme v Môle-Saint-Nicolas

512
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:35,520
Tato obec se nazývá
Môle-Saint-Nicolas a bylo to zde,

513
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:37,680
kde byla objevena naše země.

514
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:43,320
Když Kryštof Kolumbus

515
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:46,760
hledal koření,
aby připravil jídlo, tak zároveň

516
01:45:47,160 --> 01:45:50,480
objevil novou
zemi, která se nyní jmenuje Haiti.

517
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:09,480
Když vstoupil na zem, 
usídlili se zde se svojí posádkou

518
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:12,120
a založil svoji novou pevnost.

519
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:22,480
Místo je označeno
stopou Kryštofa Kolumba.

520
01:46:51,160 --> 01:46:54,120
Okolo roku 2012,

521
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:59,080
jsem potkal kamaráda Juliena,
který chtěl provozovat kitesurfing

522
01:46:59,080 --> 01:47:00,520
v Dominikánské republice

523
01:47:01,960 --> 01:47:06,000
Začal jsem tedy 
s ním, až mě pozval sem na tohle místo.

524
01:47:06,640 --> 01:47:09,760
Mým cílem bylo vrátit se Haiti,

525
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:13,760
pracovat tady a rozvíjet kitesurfing.

526
01:47:14,160 --> 01:47:16,800
Bylo to pro mě dokonalé.

527
01:47:31,120 --> 01:47:35,680
Přál bych si 
nadále rozvíjet kitesurfing na Haiti.

528
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:40,000
Je to velké lákadlo
pro lidi, kteří sem přicházejí z jiných zemí.

529
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,320
Ne pro ty, kteří tady už bydlí.

530
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:27,040
Rád bych viděl
další lidi, či Evropany,

531
01:48:27,680 --> 01:48:31,880
kteří by sem přijeli
objevovat krásné pláže,

532
01:48:32,680 --> 01:48:34,640
ten krásný kout, který tady máme.

533
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:42,640
Je dobré to tady
navštívit a zažít velké dobrodružství.

534
01:48:50,040 --> 01:48:52,960
Toto je palma,
kterou Stanley zasadil.

535
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:57,880
Takže toto je
jeho zahradnický počin.

536
01:49:10,080 --> 01:49:12,840
Sázím si na Haiti
svojí kokosovou palmu.

537
01:49:13,680 --> 01:49:15,160
Vyroste to tak za 10 let,

538
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:17,640
ale až to vyroste, 
tak tady budu mít svojí vlastní palmu,

539
01:49:17,640 --> 01:49:20,080
takže si budu lítat
na Haiti na své vlastní kokosy.

540
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:24,840
Tý jo, po kosech
jsme teď ulepení od cukrové třtiny.

541
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:29,400
Dáme si ještě cukrovou třtinu?

542
01:51:34,200 --> 01:51:35,240
Pokud...

543
01:51:36,440 --> 01:51:37,440
mám...

544
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:40,120
srovnat

545
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:42,920
život na Haiti

546
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:45,920
a život v České republice

547
01:51:47,080 --> 01:51:50,920
je to úplně, naprosto jiný život.

548
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:54,920
Myslím si, že v České republice

549
01:51:56,520 --> 01:51:58,360
jsou postavené cesty.

550
01:51:59,480 --> 01:52:00,680
V České republice

551
01:52:01,160 --> 01:52:02,440
jsou velké

552
01:52:03,320 --> 01:52:04,560
supermarkety,

553
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:07,240
velké

554
01:52:08,120 --> 01:52:09,040
podniky.

555
01:52:09,680 --> 01:52:12,760
Jsou tam velké továrny, 

556
01:52:13,480 --> 01:52:16,760
velcí ekonomové,

557
01:52:17,560 --> 01:52:18,720
kteří pracují.

558
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:20,560
Jsou tam velké

559
01:52:22,320 --> 01:52:23,480
osobnosti,

560
01:52:23,480 --> 01:52:25,120
které mají spousty prostředků.

561
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:29,120
Postavili 

562
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:32,640
domy a vytvořili

563
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:37,080
pracovní příležitosti,
aby dali lidem v České republice práci.

564
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:40,320
Mladí lidé v České republice

565
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,560
najdou práci daleko snadněji.

566
01:52:44,160 --> 01:52:45,960
Mají co jíst,

567
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:48,080
mají pitnou vodu.

568
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:50,600
Mají vše

569
01:52:52,600 --> 01:52:54,160
co my potřebujeme.

570
01:52:55,560 --> 01:52:56,880
Na Haiti

571
01:52:57,560 --> 01:53:00,080
moc věcí nemáme.

572
01:53:00,480 --> 01:53:01,960
Nemáme cesty,

573
01:53:03,160 --> 01:53:06,200
nemáme elektřinu,

574
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:09,160
nemáme

575
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:12,120
velké obchody.

576
01:53:13,560 --> 01:53:14,840
Nemáme

577
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:17,400
velké podniky.

578
01:53:18,480 --> 01:53:22,640
Nemáme velké
podniky, které by dávali lidem práci.

579
01:53:24,080 --> 01:53:26,400
Haiti je ale moje země

580
01:53:26,720 --> 01:53:28,040
a já mám svou zemi rád.

581
01:53:28,200 --> 01:53:31,520
Je tu hodně
turistických zajímavostí.

582
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:36,080
Máme tady přírodu,
která je opravdu pěkná.

583
01:53:37,680 --> 01:53:40,680
Návštěvníci, kteří přijíždějí na Haiti

584
01:53:41,160 --> 01:53:43,400
se ani nechtějí
vracet do svých zemí,

585
01:53:45,080 --> 01:53:46,920
protože Haiti je opravdu pěkné.

586
01:53:47,640 --> 01:53:49,840
Jsme na východě země,

587
01:53:49,840 --> 01:53:52,680
ale naše země je chudá.

588
01:53:53,480 --> 01:53:56,720
Nemáme dostatek přírodních zdrojů. 

589
01:53:57,600 --> 01:54:00,960
Nemáme ani
pořádné základní zemědělství.

590
01:54:01,680 --> 01:54:04,320
Nemáme práci.

591
01:54:05,080 --> 01:54:08,040
Na Haiti je 98 % lidí 

592
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:11,760
bez práce.

593
01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:15,000
Máme 60 % studentů,

594
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:17,440
kteří dokončili základní vzdělání,

595
01:54:18,360 --> 01:54:20,880
ale nemohou pokračovat
ve studiích na vysoké škole.

596
01:54:21,520 --> 01:54:22,480
Máme...

597
01:54:23,200 --> 01:54:24,120
máme...

598
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:27,040
studenty,

599
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:31,520
kteří dokončili základní
vzdělání, ale nemají co dělat.

600
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:33,400
A tak opouštějí zemi

601
01:54:33,400 --> 01:54:34,960
a jdou do Chile,

602
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:36,640
Dominikánské republiky

603
01:54:37,120 --> 01:54:38,240
nebo do Brazílie,

604
01:54:39,320 --> 01:54:42,360
aby utekli
před bídou do jiných zemí,

605
01:54:43,120 --> 01:54:45,680
protože na Haiti není...

606
01:54:49,080 --> 01:54:51,360
není z čeho těžit.

607
01:54:51,360 --> 01:54:55,200
Já ale na Haiti zůstávám,
protože mám rád svou zemi.

608
01:54:56,240 --> 01:54:57,840
Haiti je krásná země.

609
01:54:57,840 --> 01:55:01,120
Je to moje země, má vlast.

610
01:55:02,120 --> 01:55:04,560
Je to země mého otce,

611
01:55:04,560 --> 01:55:07,680
země mé matky
a je to také moje země

612
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:09,920
a já mám rád svou zemi.

613
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:15,360
Ale je hodně věcí,
které je třeba na Haiti změnit.

614
01:55:26,200 --> 01:55:28,200
Já piju.

615
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:31,600
Ty piješ.

616
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:34,360
On pije.

617
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:37,320
My pijeme...

618
01:55:38,040 --> 01:55:38,760
pijeme.

619
01:55:39,440 --> 01:55:40,800
Vy pijete.

620
01:55:41,960 --> 01:55:44,040
Oni pijí.

621
01:55:56,840 --> 01:55:57,920
To je všechno.

622
01:55:58,280 --> 01:55:59,400
Mockrát Vám děkuji.
